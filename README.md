Because the code had reached a certain size, I had to split it into multiple files.<br/>
I also chose to do this to get more readability. Everyone should have the possibility to modify the code for his/her needs.<br/>
<br/>
Files:<br/>
.bashrc<br/>
- standard commandline mods and includes<br/>

.bash_aliases<br/>
- all aliases are here<br/>

.bash_functions<br/>
- all functions are here<br/>

.gitrc<br/>
- it's some kind of extension for git commands<br/>
  - BETA !<br/>

.gitlab-conf.sh<br/>
- this script will give you a gitlab / github standardized gitconfig<br/>
  - CAREFUL: other gitconfig files in home folder will be overwritten<br/>
  - BETA !<br/>

<br/>
  the sample folder holds some sample config files you can use to create your configs<br/>
