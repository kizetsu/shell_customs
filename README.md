Because the code had reached a certain size, I had to split it into multiple files.
I also chose to do this to get more readability. Everyone should have the possibility to modify the code for his/her needs.

Files:
.bashrc
- standard commandline mods and includes
.bash_aliases
- all aliases are here
.bash_functions
- all functions are here
.gitrc
- it's some kind of extension for git commands
  -> BETA !
.gitlab-conf.sh
- this script will give you a gitlab / github standardized gitconfig
  -> CAREFUL: other gitconfig files in home folder will be overwritten
  -> BETA !

  the sample folder holds some sample config files you can use to create your configs
